        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is one of those soup dishes ideal for warming the soul during a winter day. This is similar to an Italian wedding soup but creamy with meatballs and potato gnocchi. I make my own chicken stock and meatballs but you can use store-bought.</p>

            <li>2 (17.5 ounce) packages potato gnocchi</li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>6 ounces fresh baby spinach leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh basil or Italian parsley</li>
            <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or more as needed for serving</li>
            <p><strong>Meatballs:</strong></p>
            <li>1 ¼ pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>¼ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and saute onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add chicken stock, bay leaf, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper and bring liquid slowly up to a simmer, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the meatballs. Combine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, onion powder, Italian seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix until well combined. Roll mixture into tiny 1/2-inch meatballs.</li>
            <li>Once the soup is boiling, carefully drop meatballs one by one into the pot. Bring back up to a slow simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Skim off any gray muck that comes to the top with a spoon and discard.</li>
            <li>Add carrots, escarole, and gnocchi and bring soup back to a simmer. Stir in half-and-half, spinach, and herbs. When gnocchi rise to the top, remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Remove bay leaf and serve soup with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>

        <p>You can use ground turkey instead of ground beef.</p>

        <p>You can refrigerate the soup after the meatballs are cooked overnight and skim fat off the top the next day.</p>
